# Code Quality

- Code quality is a set of practices that help to ensure that your code is readable, maintainable, and reliable. Linters, Code Formatters, and Consistent Coding Styles are some of the tools that can help you maintain code quality. Ability to debug in the browser and use testing frameworks are also important in establishing code quality.
